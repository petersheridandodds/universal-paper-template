-------------------------

Basic set up with some good-form suggestions:

-------------------------

1. 

Name the paper directory with YYYY-MMpaper-file-name structure
This allows for time sorting and time is the big index.
After, say, ten years, fronting dates in file names and directories
will prove very helpful.

For example:
% mkdir 2013-05many-languages-happiness

~/papers/[category]/

-------------------------

2. 

Deploy the base files via github or unpack the latest .tgz file.

-------------------------

3. 

Use ./bin/rename to change paper-template in 
to paper-file-name for all paper-template* files:

% ./bin/rename paper-template paper-file-name paper-template*

Good form: use the same name as the directory, without the date prefix.

For example:

% ./bin/rename paper-template many-happy-languages paper-template*
or
% ./bin/rename paper-template our-work-of-towering-importance paper-template*

The LaTeX package currfile along with perl scripts
will take care of all internal naming.

3.1

Adjust small settings file to contain base name:
% make-name-match-settingsfile.pl

Run this any time the base name is renamed (per 3.)

-------------------------

Should now be able to compile:
% makerevtex4.pl -quick

-------------------------

4. 

Directories:

./archive: place for local, occasional peace-of-mind backups/snapshots. 

Use archivify to copy files into a time stamped subdirectory.
Example:
./bin/archivify *.tex *.pdf

Use this whenever, especially when overhauling a paper. 
It is presumed you are automatically backing your entire system in many 
places, including off-planet.

./bin
Home to just a few scripts.
Adding ./bin to the $PATH might increase happiness.

./correspondence

All correspondence with journals here:
cover letters,  signed licenses, payments, etc.

Cover letter template:
YYYY-MM-DDjournal-name.tex 
YYYY-MM-DDjournal-name.body.tex 

reviewers.txt: list of potential reviewers, and reviewers to exclude

./drafts

./figures

./journal-formats

./log

./package

./proofs

Store final proofs and scans of edits here

./submitted

Place for journal pdf's of entire submission.
